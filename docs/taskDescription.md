# Sleep Stage Classification System

### Context

This project focuses on developing a real-time sleep stage prediction system (REM, Deep sleep, light sleep, etc) using consumer-grade wearable devices like Apple Watches. Previously, the approach was based on [this research paper](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/42/12/zsz180/5549536?login=false).

[The original codebase](https://github.com/ojwalch/sleep_classifiers) is unnecessarily complex. The goal is to simplify it, make it more efficient and create an AI-powered mechanism to predict sleep stages in real-time.

‚ùó The dataset for this project is available at: https://physionet.org/content/sleep-accel/1.0.0/ and contains:
- heart rate ‚Üí heart rate while sleeping
- motion (x, y, z) ‚Üí motion of the wrist while sleeping  
- steps ‚Üí number of steps walked the day prior to sleep
- labels (sleep labels) ‚Üí REM, non-rem, Deep Sleep, Light Sleep

More information on this dataset can be found in the paper.

### Requirements

The system should be Python-based and able to train a Neural Network architecture to predict sleep stages. The model should be trained on 90% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 10%. The system should accept heart rate, motion, and steps data as input and output predicted sleep stage labels. While common literature suggests accuracy around ~70%, any improvements beyond this are welcome.

Since this involves time series data ([read about time series here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series)), **Transformer architectures**, **Recurrent Neural Networks** or **Long Short Term Memory Networks** are recommended as they consider states prior to the current t[i] point in time.

üí° For example, a person is more likely to be in the deep state rather than awake state if their previous state was light. That's why having prior states is so important.

‚ùó The implementation should leverage existing libraries and frameworks like sklearn, tensorflow, keras or pytorch.
